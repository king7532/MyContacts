# MyContacts

### App Definition Statement 

Imitate the iOS native Contacts.app in Swift using only the AddressBook and AddressBookUI with no Storyboards

### HELP!

I canot get the ABPersonViewController to show the navigation bar in the iOS simulator!  See the comments in the [AppDelegate.swift](https://github.com/king7532/MyContacts/blob/master/MyContacts/AppDelegate.swift#L101)  But when I pause the program execution and use the Xcode Debug View Hierarchy, it is visible.  See the [screenshot](https://github.com/king7532/MyContacts/blob/master/Xcode%2BiOSSimulator-Screenshot.png)

My question on StackOverflow:
